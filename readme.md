# Chrome_Extension_Songsterr

A Chrome browser extension to:

-   autoscroll through tabs with speed control (without premium)
-   hide the advertising banner of [Songster](https://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/sungha-jung-kamado-tanjiro-no-uta-tab-s491811)

Unfortunately, this does not work for PDF tabs, because Chrome's built-in PDF viewer cannot be manipulated like a website.
